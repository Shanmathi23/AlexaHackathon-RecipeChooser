Combine allspice, garlic, scallions, hot pepper, lime juice, soy sauce, vegetable oil, salt, black pepper, thyme, nutmeg and cinnamon in a food processor and process until smooth.
Split chickens in half by cutting along each side of the spine with kitchen shears and removing it, then cutting down the center of the breast.
Place chicken in large dish and slather with half of jerk seasoning; allow to sit in the fridge overnight.
The following day, preheat oven to 425°, or preheat an outdoor grill.
If using an outdoor grill, use indirect heat to cook the chickens; jerk tends to burn over high heat.
If using an oven cook until internal temperature is 160°, about 50 minutes.
Serve with lime wedges.
